Here we deal with the head where we put the style and within it we put all the changes that
we want to see happen on the body of our web.

    <h1>WOMEN IN TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <span>Women have always been despised in the Afrcian society, not in a way that they are of no importance but in a way that they couldn't do as much as the men could. In so stating, many of the wome have grown weary oon their dreams and desires thinking that as things are defined by society, they surely can't really do much.
    However, things have started to get a little bit different in a sense that women have been empowered and they have started believing in themselves and in the fact they actually have the <emp>same potential</emp> as men do.
    </span> <br>
   <p>Due to that growth of belief in themselves, Women'S Institute In Technology and Innovation was birthed by Miss Birungi Barbra to empower women with technological knowledge just as men are empowered so as to birth new ideas in the world of technology.</p>
